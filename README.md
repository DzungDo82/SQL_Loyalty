# Retail Loyalty Program Analysis
### Tool used: SQL

-	Utilized SQL to create and analyze a database, answering business questions on sales performance, store rankings, and customer loyalty.
-	Verify, correct, and standardize the transaction date format ('%m/%d/%Y') across 10 CSV files, and then integrate them into a cohesive dataset.
-	Analyzed transactions with negative sales/units, assessed transaction table span, and evaluated monthly and yearly sales growth, alongside store performance, loyalty program effectiveness, and top-performing stores and product categories based on provincial performance.
